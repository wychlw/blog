# overview

It's my blog, powered by Hexo.

# public

You make found that, some posts in the website dosen't present at here.
That's true. This is the public side of my blog automatic deployed by GitHub Action.

So what has been removed? Actually I use the .gitignore file to achieve this. You may find what file I removed in it.

However, I let the Action sync my commits as well. So the commits are real (But the changes not!)

The change commit:
> So from now on, the blog will be seprated into two parts: the private
part and the public part.
> The reason is that I need to hide some private infomation, and... Not
let you see some of the source files.
> However, instead of not showing what happened to the private part, I
believe make other know the changes... is some how rather important to
me.
> So, first: though I couldn't let you know some of the modifications, all
the commits will be synchronized.
> Second you will know WHAT files has been hidden. To do this, I simply
use a .gitignore file. So you can see what files has been ignored to
this branch.
> These changes won't affect my blog webpages in theory(hopefully).
